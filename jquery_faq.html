<h1>Yosemite National Park: 10 FAQ</h1>
<dl>
    <dt><h5>Why are animals so tame here? Can I feed them?</h5></dt>
    <br>
    <dd class="invisible">Animals in the park are wild, but many are accustomed to people because they have been fed so often. It is
        illegal to feed any animal in the park. Feeding animals contributes to poor nutrition, ill health, and the
        alteration of natural behavior patterns. Visitors who get close to or feed animals may also be bitten,
        scratched, or otherwise injured, or may become ill. </dd>
<br>
<hr>
    <dt><h5>How can I protect bears from my food (and my food from bears)?</h5></dt>
    <br>
    <dd class="invisible">Yosemite's bears are always searching for food and consider anything that looks or smells like food to be food.
        Learn more about how to properly store your food while visiting Yosemite.</dd>
<br>
<hr>
    <dt><h5>How can I protect myself from bears?</h5></dt>
    <br>
    <dd class="invisible">Black bears in Yosemite tend to avoid people and can be scared off. Learn what to do if you see a bear.</dd>
<br>
<hr>
    <dt><h5>What is there to see in Yosemite?</h5></dt>
    <br>
    <dd class="invisible">Yosemite Valley, Wawona, Mariposa Grove, Hetch Hetchy, Waterfalls, Lakes & Rivers, and much more!</dd>
<br>
<hr>
    <dt><h5>When do the Half Dome cables go up and come down?</h5></dt>
    <br>
    <dd class="invisible">The Half Dome cables are normally installed immediately before Memorial Day weekend, but this can vary depending
        on conditions and trail crew availability. The cables usually remain up through Columbus Day (in October). A
        permit is required to hike Half Dome. The National Park Service strongly discourages hikers from attempting the
        cable route when the cables are down. Learn more about the Half Dome hike.</dd>
<br>
<hr>
    <dt><h5>Where and when can I see Horsetail Fall, the waterfall that resembles the Firefall?</h5></dt>
    <br>
    <dd class="invisible">Horsetail Fall flows in winter and early spring, when snow is present on top of El Capitan.
        On sunny afternoons in mid- to late February, the setting sun can cause it to glow orange.</dd>
<br>
<hr>
    <dt><h5>Where can I see giant sequoias?</h5></dt>
    <br>
    <dd class="invisible">There are three giant sequoia groves in Yosemite National Park: the Mariposa Grove, the Tuolumne Grove, and the
        Merced Grove.</dd>
<br>
<hr>
    <dt><h5>Where and when can I see frazil ice?</h5></dt>
    <br>
    <dd class="invisible">Frazil ice forms along Yosemite Creek, and some other creeks in Yosemite Valley, most commonly in March and
        April. The phenomenon is entirely weather-dependent, so it's difficult to know when exactly it may happen (or
        if it will happen at all).</dd>
<br>
<hr>
    <dt><h5>When is the best time of year to visit Yosemite?</h5></dt>
    <br>
    <dd class="invisible">It depends what you're looking for! While most people visit Yosemite during summer, there are advantages to
        visiting throughout the year. </dd>
<br>
<hr>
    <dt><h5>Can I drive my own vehicle into the park?</h5></dt>
    <br>
    <dd class="invisible">You can drive your own vehicle into and around Yosemite (shuttle buses are not mandatory, but are
        recommended).</dd>
